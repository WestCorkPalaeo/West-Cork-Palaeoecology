# West-Cork-Palaeoecology
## Researching and discovering the historical ecology and environments of West Cork.
#### Creating a Web Portal to Open Science and Data in a study of the Palaeoecology of West Cork
This project is an investigation into the history of the environment and ecology of West Cork in south west Ireland. The principle motivation is to gain a more complete understanding of the history of the area since the last Ice Age and contribute to existing gaps in the palaeoecological, geographical, and archaeological data.  
  * Sediment cores from various lakes and bogs, principally lowland, in West Cork are being, and will be, sampled, processed, and analysed, although at present (Winter-spring 2020-2021) movement is hampered by COVID restrictions.   
  * The principles of Open Working are being employed to ensure that the project as a whole will be accessible to everyone, understandable by everyone and of interest for everyone.
  * It is hoped that this project will, by enabling a better understanding of the landscape, serve to increase awareness of the importance of the environment, how it can best be managed, and how we can all benefit from taking better care of it.   
  * The website at www.westcorkpalaeo.com is under development – by me – and currently focuses principally on the foundations of the region, the geology, sedimentology, and landscape history. (Note that it is subject at the present time (Spring 2021) to major editing changes).     
  * It is also intended to upload microscope photographs of micro fossils - pollen, spores, diatoms, sponge spicules, phytoliths etc. as reference data.    
  * Possiby also selections of interest from the cores.   
  * I am open to participation and contribution by anyone who is interested.   
  * This project is entirely self funded at the moment, apart from a grant from IQUA received two years ago to fund radiocarbon dates.   
  * This GitHub repository and all associated documentation has been created under guidance and encouragement of the Open Life Science cohort 3 mentoring course in which I am enrolled.
